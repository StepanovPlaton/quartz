Sergei Pavlovich Korolev is the founder of the Soviet space program. Korolev, like many of his colleagues, went through Stalin's prisons and later participated in the search for rocket technology in occupied Germany. His energy, intelligence and belief in the prospects of space flight made him the head of the first Soviet rocket development center. He deserves the most credits for turning rocket weapons into an instrument of space exploration and making the Soviet Union the world's first space-faring nation.

Korolev graduated from the university in 1929 and in 1931 he joined the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute. In July 1932, Korolev was appointed chief of Jet Propulsion Research Group. In 1933, the group was reorganized into the Jet Propulsion Research Institute, where Korolev worked as Deputy Chief of the institute.

At the peak of his career, Korolev led the development of the world's first ballistic missile, which are known today as R-7.

In the following years, several generations of ballistic missiles, artificial science, military and communications satellites were being developed. The Soyuz spacecraft which turned 40 years in operation in 2006, was created and launched under his guidance. Korolev died at the height of his career on January 14, 1966.

Due to secret nature of the Soviet space industry, Korolev's contribution was publically recognized only after his death.
